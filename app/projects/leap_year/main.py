# Leap Year

# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, 
# leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.

# Three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:

# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

# The year must be evenly divisible by 4; If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, 
# it is not a leap year; **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

# e.g. The year 2000:

# 2000 รท 4 = 500 (Leap)

# 2000 รท 100 = 20 (Not Leap)

# 2000 รท 400 = 5 (Leap!)

# So the year 2000 is a leap year.
